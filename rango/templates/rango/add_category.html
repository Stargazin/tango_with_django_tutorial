<!--i think action automatically looks for a view function?-->
<!--or maybe the id looks for category_form in forms.py?-->
<!--category_form isn't defined anywhere... so i think that's out of the question^,
i think it is action looking for add_category function in views...
kind of makes sense b/c for the function, the context_dict has key 'form' which we use
below even though it's not used as a template var
so i think here we intially use GET when we get to the page and then when we save
the method below turns it to POST and we save and go back to index...-->
<!--!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! jk!!! haha... so the action points to a URL... i think the idea is that
the template doesn't get pulled unless a request is made and the view function uses the template
and at that point, the form should be the correct one (although i'm not sure what happens if you have
multiple forms on one page, but i don't think i've seen that before... i guess you would "name" them?-->

<!--!!! see the action below? the tango tutorial said to put it but that gets you double in url...
so you get rango/add_cat/rango/add_cat... just leave it out and it works fine-->

    <!--Note from tutorial:
The need for hidden as well as visible form fields is necessitated by the fact that HTTP is a stateless protocol.
You canâ€™t persist state between different HTTP requests which can make certain parts of web applications
difficult to implement. To overcome this limitation, hidden HTML form fields were created which allow web
applications to pass important information to a client (which cannot be seen on the rendered page) in a HTML
form, only to be sent back to the originating server when the user submits the form.-->
